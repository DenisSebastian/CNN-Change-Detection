  abstract = {Peatlands are a type of wetland characterized by the accumulation of organic matter, called peat, and are important carbon reservoirs. In areas with poor drainage, human-induced forest fires and logging can produce flooded conditions and organic matter accumulation, which generates an ecosystem called anthropogenic peatland. Productive management activities such as Sphagnum moss harvesting and livestock grazing take place there. Our hypothesis was that productive management has a strong impact on the aboveground C reservoir and increases the presence of exotic species. We established 44 sampling points in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland on Chiloé Island, Chile, comparing productive and conservation types of managements. Carbon stocks, vegetation structure and composition variables were quantified. These variables were used to classify the ecosystem into microsites to analyze the different locations in the peatland. In addition, predictive models of aboveground carbon were created using Landsat 8 OLI and Pleiades images. The results revealed a carbon stock of 11.99 ± 0.77 kg C m−2, which is smaller than in natural peatlands, and showed a wide variability of conditions within the peatland itself. This variability, mainly expressed in aboveground carbon, produces microsites dominated by either shrubs, species of the genus Juncus or grasses. Productive management reduced accumulated carbon in the aboveground stock and in the woody debris. However, the strongest impact was found on the vegetation variables, with a decrease in total cover, cover of shrubs and herbaceous plants, and in vegetation height. There was also an increase in the richness and presence of exotic species. The spatial prediction of aboveground carbon yielded significant results using only spectral indices, showing also that the impact of productive management is not homogenous, being less intense in waterlogged areas. This study is the first to quantify carbon reservoirs in this type of ecosystem and to propose variables that can be used as indicators of the impact of human activities.},

  abstract = {In the Maipo watershed, situated in central Chile, mining activities are impacting high altitude Andean wetlands through the consumption and exploitation of water and land. As wetlands are vulnerable and particularly susceptible to changes of water supply, alterations and modifications in the hydrological regime have direct effects on their ecophysiological condition and vegetation cover. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of Worldview-2 and Sentinel-2 sensors to identify and map Andean wetlands through the use of the one-class classifier Bias support vector machines (BSVM), and then to estimate soil moisture content of the identified wetlands during snow-free summer using partial least square regression. The results obtained in this research showed that the combination of remote sensing data and a small sample of ground reference measurements enables to map Andean high altitude wetlands with high accuracies. BSVM was capable to classify the meadow areas with an overall accuracy of over ∼78\% for both sensors. Our results also indicate that it is feasible to map surface soil moisture with optical remote sensing data and simple regression approaches in the examined environment. Surface soil moisture estimates reached r2 values of up to 0.58, and normalized mean square errors of 19\% using Sentinel-2 data, while Worldview-2 estimates resulted in non-satisfying results. The presented approach is particularly valuable for monitoring high-mountain wetland areas with limited accessibility such as in the Andes.},
